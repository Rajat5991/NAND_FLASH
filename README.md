# NAND_FLASH - A Potential Contender for DNN
Traditional computing systems typically store massive information on a memory unit that is physically connected to the computational unit by a data bus. The
continuous data movement between the processing and the memory units represents the main bottleneck due to the limited bandwidth, long latency, sequential data processing, and
high energy consumption.
