# NAND_FLASH - A Potential Contender for DNN
Traditional computing systems Fig.1 typically store massive information on a memory unit that is physically connected to the computational unit by a data bus. The continuous data movement between the processing and the memory units represents the main bottleneck due to the limited bandwidth, long latency, sequential data processing, and high energy consumption. To minimize the latency and energy overhead of conventional von Neumann computers, in-memory computing (IMC) aims at performing the computation within the memory.
